# Project 0

The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and its paradigms by creating
a TODO app. This app should be able to add TODOs and track the number of total
TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs, as well as have a delete button for each individual todo.

## Credit to CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native on Edx
This was the first project under this course, so far so good. So as of 2 lectures in, I recommend it! If you haven't taken the normal CS50 course on Edx (for free) I highly encourage everyone to take it.
